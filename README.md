# 481-HW6

For 1st commit:

What I (Jim) did in the zip file:
Instead of using the folder downloaded from sympy's Github, I used pip install sympy.
This is because when pip installs a package, it creates both the sympy folder and the sympy-1.11.1.dist-info folder, inside the site-packages folder. And the sympy-1.11.1.dist-info folder is needed for that package to be run from another file in VS Code.

What to do now:
Figure out which Python file is for plot_implicit. And change it so that it supports label and legend.
